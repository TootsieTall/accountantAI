# Windows Unicode Fix - URGENT FIX

## Problem

Windows is experiencing Unicode encoding issues, causing the app to crash on Windows with errors like:

```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2192' in position 0: character maps to <undefined>
```

## Quick Fix Instructions

1. Run this patch script to remove all Unicode characters from source files:

```
python patch.py
```

2. If the app still crashes, manually replace `src/file_handler.py` with `src/fixed_file_handler.py`:

```
# On Windows:
copy src\fixed_file_handler.py src\file_handler.py

# On Mac/Linux:
cp src/fixed_file_handler.py src/file_handler.py
```

3. Restart the application completely (not just the processing)

## Technical Details

The issue is that Windows command prompt uses non-Unicode encoding (usually cp1252), which doesn't support special characters like:
- Checkmarks (✓)
- Arrows (→)
- Warning symbols (⚠)
- X marks (✗)

Our fix:
1. Created a patch script to scan and replace all Unicode with ASCII alternatives
2. Provided a guaranteed Unicode-free version of file_handler.py
3. Updated logging to use ASCII-only characters

## Success Confirmation

You'll know the fix worked when:
1. The application processes all files without crashing
2. You see files in the processed folder for your client
3. The log shows ASCII characters like [OK], [X], and ->

If problems still persist, let us know!
